# Online-Shoppers-Purchasing-Intention
We have created a logit Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for Real-Time Prediction of Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention based on the paper (Sakar et al. 2019). The data have been downloaded from (Dua and Graff 2017) University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository.

We want to predict whether next customer visiting a web page will be a Revenue or not. We have selected this set of uncorrelated regressors with the most statistical significance: `Administrative`, `Informational`, `PageValues`, `SpecialDay`, `Month`, `OperatingSystems`, `TrafficType`, `VisitorType`, `ProductRelated_Duration`, `ExitRates`. and we have created a Logit Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to do that prediction.
